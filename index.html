              <p class ="p1">I am Board Certified Clinical Psychologist in private practice who has been lucky enough over the years to have experienced two distinctly separate careers, as a television writer/producer (I was one of the writers for the original Jeopardy!)  and a licensed psychologist.</p>
              <p class ="p2">For thirty years I lived in Los Angeles where I worked in communities of poverty and violence among many folks with multiple needs. Moving to the DC area fourteen years ago, has taught me about life transitions.</p>
              <p class ="p3">I have had the honor to serve those who serve our country working at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for over a decade. Cancer patients, their loved ones, the returning service men and women have given me much insight into how to support and guide those who experience profound transitions in their live. These men and women have shown me the importance of hope and that wounds can heal.</p>
